## Hi there, I’m Mohamed! 👋

I’m a **Software Engineer** based in Spain, driven by a deep curiosity for **Systems Engineering**, **Backend Development**, and **DevOps**.

I don't just use tools; I build them from scratch to understand how they work. Whether it's a relational database engine, a visualization platform for complex algorithms, or an SSH-based chat server, I build to learn.

### 🛠️ Core Technologies
* **Languages:** Go, TypeScript, C++, C.
* **Infrastructure:** Docker, Grafana, Prometheus, Linux.
* **Current Interests:** Storage Engines, Distributed Systems, Database Internals, Network Protocols.
